# ðŸŽ‚ Pixel Cake Generator

A frontend project that creates a unique pixel-style birthday cake based on your name â€” each cake is procedurally generated with vibrant colors and decorations in pixel-perfect detail.

Built with **React**, **Vite**, and **HTML5 Canvas**.

## How It Works (Procedural Generation)

### String-to-Hash
- The user's input (like their name) is converted into a numeric hash using a custom function.
- This hash ensures consistent outputs â€” the same name will always generate the same cake.

### Hash-to-Visuals
- The hash is used to:
  - Pick **base**, **frosting**, and **decoration** colors (using HSL color math)
  - Determine how many **layers** (2â€“4) the cake has
  - Randomly place **cherries**, **decorations**, and **candles**

### Canvas Rendering
- The cake is drawn on a `<canvas>` using the HTML5 Canvas API.
- Each cake layer is drawn as pixel blocks on a 16x16 grid.
- Candles are animated using the `requestAnimationFrame` loop and canvas shadows to simulate glowing flames.

### Deterministic Output (no randomness)
- Because the hash is derived from the name and used for all layout/color logic, the output is fully deterministic.
- This makes the app behave like a **procedural avatar generator** (like GitHub avatar), but for cakes.

## Tech Stack

- **React** for the interactive UI
- **Vite** for lightning-fast dev/build tooling
- **HTML5 Canvas** for pixel drawing and animations
- **CSS** for the retro neon aesthetic
